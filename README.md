# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

# Food Search App

This is my second project in the journey of learning React. In this project, I've built a simple application that allows users to search for food recipes and get detailed information about each recipe. The app uses the Spoonacular API to fetch recipe data, including ingredients, instructions, and nutritional information.

## Features
- **Search for Recipes**: Users can search for any food item and get a list of related recipes.
- **Detailed Recipe Information**: After selecting a recipe, users can view detailed information including preparation time, ingredients, instructions, and more.
- **Responsive Design**: The app adjusts its layout to fit different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: For building the user interface and managing the application state.
- **Spoonacular API**: To fetch food recipes and detailed data.
- **CSS**: For styling the application.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mesalm/food-search-app.git

    Navigate to the project folder:

cd food-search-app

Install the dependencies:

npm install

Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add your Spoonacular API key:

VITE_API_KEY=your-api-key

Run the app:

    npm start

    Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to see the app in action.
